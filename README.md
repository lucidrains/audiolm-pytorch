## AudioLM - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/">AudioLM</a>, a Language Modeling Approach to Audio Generation out of Google Research, in Pytorch

It also extends the work for conditioning with classifier free guidance with T5. This allows for one to do text-to-audio or TTS, not offered in the paper.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install audiolm-pytorch
```

## Usage

First, `SoundStream` needs to be trained on a large corpus of audio data

```python
from audiolm_pytorch import SoundStream, SoundStreamTrainer

soundstream = SoundStream(
    codebook_size = 1024,
    rq_num_quantizers = 8,
)

trainer = SoundStreamTrainer(
    soundstream,
    folder = '/path/to/librispeech',
    batch_size = 4,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 10000
).cuda()

trainer.train()
```

Then three separate transformers (`SemanticTransformer`, `CoarseTransformer`, `FineTransformer`) need to be trained


ex. `SemanticTransformer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import HubertWithKmeans, SemanticTransformer, SemanticTransformerTrainer

# hubert checkpoints can be downloaded at
# https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/hubert

wav2vec = HubertWithKmeans(
    checkpoint_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960.pt',
    kmeans_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960_L9_km500.bin'
)

semantic_transformer = SemanticTransformer(
    num_semantic_tokens = 500,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6
).cuda()


trainer = SemanticTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = semantic_transformer,
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    folder = '/home/phil/dl/data/LibriSpeech',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 1
)

trainer.train()
```

ex. `CoarseTransformer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import HubertWithKmeans, SoundStream, CoarseTransformer, CoarseTransformerWrapper, CoarseTransformerTrainer

wav2vec = HubertWithKmeans(
    checkpoint_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960.pt',
    kmeans_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960_L9_km500.bin'
)

soundstream = SoundStream(
    codebook_size = 1024,
    rq_num_quantizers = 8,
)

soundstream.load('/path/to/trained/soundstream.pt')

coarse_transformer = CoarseTransformer(
    codebook_size = 1024,
    num_coarse_quantizers = 3,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    num_semantic_tokens = 320
)

trainer = CoarseTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = coarse_transformer,
    soundstream = soundstream,
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    folder = '/home/phil/dl/data/LibriSpeech',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 10000
)

trainer.train()
```

ex. `FineTransformer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import SoundStream, FineTransformer, FineTransformerWrapper, FineTransformerTrainer

soundstream = SoundStream(
    codebook_size = 1024,
    rq_num_quantizers = 8,
)

soundstream.load('/path/to/trained/soundstream.pt')

fine_transformer = FineTransformer(
    num_coarse_quantizers = 3,
    num_fine_quantizers = 5,
    codebook_size = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6
)

trainer = FineTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = fine_transformer,
    soundstream = soundstream,
    folder = '/home/phil/dl/data/LibriSpeech',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 10000
)

trainer.train()
```

All together now

```python
from audiolm_pytorch import AudioLM

audiolm = AudioLM(
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    soundstream = soundstream,
    semantic_transformer = semantic_transformer,
    coarse_transformer = coarse_transformer,
    fine_transformer = fine_transformer
)

generated_wav = audiolm(batch_size = 1)

# or with priming

generated_wav_with_prime = audiolm(prime_wave = torch.randn(1, 320 * 8))

# or with text condition, if given

generated_wav_with_text_condition = audiolm(text = ['chirping of birds and the distant echos of bells'])

```

## Todo

- [x] complete CoarseTransformer
- [x] use fairseq vq-wav2vec for embeddings
- [x] add conditioning
- [x] add classifier free guidance
- [x] add unique consecutive for 
- [x] incorporate ability to use hubert intermediate features as semantic tokens, recommended by <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch/discussions/13">eonglints</a>
- [x] accommodate variable lengthed audio, bring in eos token
- [x] make sure unique consecutive works with coarse transformer
- [x] pretty printing all discriminator losses to log
- [x] handle when generating semantic tokens, that last logits may not be necessarily the last in the sequence given unique consecutive processing
- [x] complete sampling code for both Coarse and Fine Transformers, which will be tricky
- [x] make sure full inference with or without prompting works on the `AudioLM` class
- [x] complete full training code for soundstream, taking care of discriminator training
- [x] add efficient gradient penalty for discriminators for soundstream
- [x] wire up sample hz from sound dataset -> transformers, and have proper resampling within during training - think about whether to allow for dataset to have sound files of varying or enforce same sample hz
- [x] full transformer training code for all three transformers
- [x] refactor so semantic transformer has a wrapper to that handles unique consecutives as well as wav to hubert or vq-wav2vec
- [x] simply not self attend to eos token on the prompting side (semantic for coarse transformer, coarse for fine transformer)
- [x] add structured dropout from forgetful causal masking, far better than traditional dropouts

- [ ] figure out how to do the normalization across each dimension mentioned in the paper, but ignore it for v1 of the framework
- [ ] offer option to weight tie coarse, fine, and semantic embeddings across the 3 hierarchical transformers
- [ ] DRY a little at the end
- [ ] figure out how to suppress logging in fairseq
- [ ] test with speech synthesis for starters
- [ ] abstract out conditioning + classifier free guidance into external module or potentially a package
- [ ] add option to use flash attention
- [ ] simplify training even more within AudioLM class
- [ ] cli tool, something like `audiolm generate <wav.file | text>` and save generated wav file to local directory
- [ ] validation function within audiolm that ensures all the pieces are compatible
- [ ] return a list of waves in the case of variable lengthed audio
