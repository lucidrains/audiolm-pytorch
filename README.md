## AudioLM - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/">AudioLM</a>, a Language Modeling Approach to Audio Generation out of Google Research, in Pytorch

It also extends the work for conditioning with classifier free guidance with T5. This allows for one to do text-to-audio or TTS, not offered in the paper. Yes, this means <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">VALL-E</a> can be trained from this repository. It is essentially the same.

This repository now also contains a MIT licensed version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312">SoundStream</a>. It is also compatible with <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec">EnCodec</a>, which is also [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec/commit/349b72939f57cb3bc7b60906c0ee8228c849485d) at the time of writing.

Update: AudioLM was essentially used to 'solve' music generation in the new <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/musiclm-pytorch">MusicLM</a>

In the future, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olNvmUCmY8o">this movie clip</a> would no longer make any sense. You would just prompt an AI instead.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install audiolm-pytorch
```

## Usage

### SoundStream & Encodec

There are two options for the neural codec. If you want to use the pretrained 24kHz Encodec, just create an Encodec object as follows:
```python
from audiolm_pytorch import EncodecWrapper
encodec = EncodecWrapper()
# Now you can use the encodec variable in the same way you'd use the soundstream variables below.
```

Otherwise, to stay more true to the original paper, you can use `SoundStream`. First, `SoundStream` needs to be trained on a large corpus of audio data

```python
from audiolm_pytorch import SoundStream, SoundStreamTrainer

soundstream = SoundStream(
    codebook_size = 4096,
    rq_num_quantizers = 8,
    rq_groups = 2,                      # this paper proposes using multi-headed residual vector quantization - https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02765
    use_lookup_free_quantizer = True,   # whether to use residual lookup free quantization
    attn_window_size = 128,             # local attention receptive field at bottleneck
    attn_depth = 2                      # 2 local attention transformer blocks - the soundstream folks were not experts with attention, so i took the liberty to add some. encodec went with lstms, but attention should be better
)

trainer = SoundStreamTrainer(
    soundstream,
    folder = '/path/to/audio/files',
    batch_size = 4,
    grad_accum_every = 8,         # effective batch size of 32
    data_max_length_seconds = 2,  # train on 2 second audio
    num_train_steps = 1_000_000
).cuda()

trainer.train()

# after a lot of training, you can test the autoencoding as so

soundstream.eval() # your soundstream must be in eval mode, to avoid having the residual dropout of the residual VQ necessary for training

audio = torch.randn(10080).cuda()
recons = soundstream(audio, return_recons_only = True) # (1, 10080) - 1 channel
```

Your trained `SoundStream` can be used as a generic tokenizer for audio

```python

soundstream.eval()

audio = torch.randn(1, 512 * 320)

codes = soundstream(audio, return_codes_only = True)

# you can now train anything with the codebook ids

recon_audio_from_codes = soundstream.decode_from_codebook_indices(codes)

# sanity check

assert torch.allclose(
    recon_audio_from_codes,
    soundstream(audio, return_recons_only = True)
)
```

You can also use soundstreams that are specific to `AudioLM` and `MusicLM` by importing `AudioLMSoundStream` and `MusicLMSoundStream` respectively

```python
from audiolm_pytorch import AudioLMSoundStream, MusicLMSoundStream

soundstream = AudioLMSoundStream(...) # say you want the hyperparameters as in Audio LM paper

# rest is the same as above
```

As of version `0.17.0`, you can now invoke the class method on `SoundStream` to load from checkpoint files, without having to remember your configurations.

```python
from audiolm_pytorch import SoundStream

soundstream = SoundStream.init_and_load_from('./path/to/checkpoint.pt')
```

### Hierarchical Transformers

Then three separate transformers (`SemanticTransformer`, `CoarseTransformer`, `FineTransformer`) need to be trained


ex. `SemanticTransformer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import HubertWithKmeans, SemanticTransformer, SemanticTransformerTrainer

# hubert checkpoints can be downloaded at
# https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/hubert

wav2vec = HubertWithKmeans(
    checkpoint_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960.pt',
    kmeans_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960_L9_km500.bin'
)

semantic_transformer = SemanticTransformer(
    num_semantic_tokens = wav2vec.codebook_size,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    flash_attn = True
).cuda()


trainer = SemanticTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = semantic_transformer,
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    folder ='/path/to/audio/files',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 1
)

trainer.train()
```

ex. `CoarseTransformer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import HubertWithKmeans, SoundStream, CoarseTransformer, CoarseTransformerTrainer

wav2vec = HubertWithKmeans(
    checkpoint_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960.pt',
    kmeans_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960_L9_km500.bin'
)

soundstream = SoundStream.init_and_load_from('/path/to/trained/soundstream.pt')

coarse_transformer = CoarseTransformer(
    num_semantic_tokens = wav2vec.codebook_size,
    codebook_size = 1024,
    num_coarse_quantizers = 3,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    flash_attn = True
)

trainer = CoarseTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = coarse_transformer,
    codec = soundstream,
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    folder = '/path/to/audio/files',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 1_000_000
)

trainer.train()
```

ex. `FineTransformer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import SoundStream, FineTransformer, FineTransformerTrainer

soundstream = SoundStream.init_and_load_from('/path/to/trained/soundstream.pt')

fine_transformer = FineTransformer(
    num_coarse_quantizers = 3,
    num_fine_quantizers = 5,
    codebook_size = 1024,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    flash_attn = True
)

trainer = FineTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = fine_transformer,
    codec = soundstream,
    folder = '/path/to/audio/files',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 1_000_000
)

trainer.train()
```

All together now

```python
from audiolm_pytorch import AudioLM

audiolm = AudioLM(
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    codec = soundstream,
    semantic_transformer = semantic_transformer,
    coarse_transformer = coarse_transformer,
    fine_transformer = fine_transformer
)

generated_wav = audiolm(batch_size = 1)

# or with priming

generated_wav_with_prime = audiolm(prime_wave = torch.randn(1, 320 * 8))

# or with text condition, if given

generated_wav_with_text_condition = audiolm(text = ['chirping of birds and the distant echos of bells'])

```

## Text Conditioned Audio Synthesis

Update: Looks like this will work, given <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">'VALL-E'</a>

ex. Semantic Transformer

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import HubertWithKmeans, SemanticTransformer, SemanticTransformerTrainer

wav2vec = HubertWithKmeans(
    checkpoint_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960.pt',
    kmeans_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960_L9_km500.bin'
)

semantic_transformer = SemanticTransformer(
    num_semantic_tokens = 500,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    has_condition = True,               # this will have to be set to True
    cond_as_self_attn_prefix = True     # whether to condition as prefix to self attention, instead of cross attention, as was done in 'VALL-E' paper
).cuda()

# mock text video dataset (as an example)

# you will have to extend your own from `Dataset`, and return an audio tensor as well as a string (the audio description) in any order (the framework will autodetect and route it into the transformer)

from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class MockTextAudioDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, length = 100, audio_length = 320 * 32):
        super().__init__()
        self.audio_length = audio_length
        self.len = length

    def __len__(self):
        return self.len

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        mock_audio = torch.randn(self.audio_length)
        mock_caption = 'audio caption'
        return mock_caption, mock_audio

dataset = MockTextAudioDataset()

# instantiate semantic transformer trainer and train

trainer = SemanticTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = semantic_transformer,
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    dataset = dataset,
    batch_size = 4,
    grad_accum_every = 8,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 1_000_000
)

trainer.train()

# after much training above

sample = trainer.generate(text = ['sound of rain drops on the rooftops'], batch_size = 1, max_length = 2) # (1, < 128) - may terminate early if it detects [eos]

```

## Multi-GPU

Because all the trainer classes uses <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator">ðŸ¤— Accelerator</a>, you can easily do multi gpu training by using the `accelerate` command as so

At the project root

```python
$ accelerate config
```

Then, in the same directory

```python
$ accelerate launch train.py
```
